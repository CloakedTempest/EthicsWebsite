	<h2>For Arguments</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Using computers running algorithms can speed up processes such as, deciding whether a bank would
			benefit from giving a client a mortage or not. This is both convenient for the customer and the
			company.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			There is no human error. The decision the algorithm makes cannot be argued against since it is 
			entirely based upon statistics and real data.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			They are significantly cheaper than paying humans to make the descisions.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="rightcol">
	<h2>Against Arguments</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Algorithms can have biases if they are trained on a biased data set. sometimes it can be difficult 
			to recognise a biased data set, especially if the programmers working on it are not diverse in 
			their experiences.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Biases in the Algorithm can change its input. This can have a runnaway effect on the biases of the 
			algorithm, making it even less acurrate. 
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Algorithms also struggle to handle situations they haven't been trained on whereas humans are good at
			improvising since they understand why they do their job.
