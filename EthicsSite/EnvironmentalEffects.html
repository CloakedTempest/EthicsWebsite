	<h1><u>The Environmental Pros and Cons of Electronics</u></h1>
	<div class="leftcol">
	<h2>For Arguments</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Computers can be used to monitor the conditions of plants, weather and the north
			and south poles with satallites. This is beneficial to the environment since it 
			makes us aware of the global conditions of the planet.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Smart meters are helping people cut down their energy use.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Our daily use of computers such as TVs helps to raise awareness in the issues
			of the environment such as animals near extinction and, of course, climate change.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="rightcol">
	<h2>Against Arguments</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Computers contribute a lot to energy waste, which leads to the burning of lots of
			fossil fuels. This makes it more difficult for people who are trying to work towards
			being carbon neutral in order to slow climate change.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Rare materials such as europium and dysprosium are used to make some componants of smartphones
			and 70 out of the 83 stable non-radioactive elecments are used in some place in smartphones.
			As can be imagined similarly to whenever a precious resource is found, there is little
			regard for the preservation of the nearby environment.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Disposal of computers is an even bigger issue than their creation, since many broken 
			compters find themselves in poorer countries where they are burned down for the priecious
			metals and components. This is almost always dangerous for the workers and poisonous to
			thye environment.
		</li>
